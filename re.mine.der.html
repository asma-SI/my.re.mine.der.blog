            Alhamdulillah for being able to afford things. Just being able to open your wallet and pay for a juice, an ice cream, a haircut, a hot meal, a book, a tank of petrol, a loaf of bread, a liter of milk,
            a cup of coffee, a bar of soap, a bus/train ticket, the fare for a taxi ride; all of these are beyond the reach of those that open their wallets to find them 
            completely empty.There are people around the world right now, at this very moment, who are absolutely broke - not a single penny on them. Try imagining that. Not a single note, not a single coin. 
            And no source to turn to, no parents/family to back them. To have never ever experienced being impecunious is one of life's greatest blessings.
            So l want everyone to take some time out and say Alhumdhulillah for everything -Thank Allah (swt) that you're in good health, wealth and state of being.   
            (Thanking Allah (swt) will only increase your blessings)

This dunya does not care about you ! No matter how much you believe the world is for you, you will always regret in the end. If you died today, the world continues without you tomorrow. The world does not wait for the 'sad' people to feel better. It moves on anyway. The world does not wait for the 'sick' people to heal. It continues on regardless. The world does not pause to mourn for the death of anyone. It goes on with or without you. The world is not for you. The more you believe the world is yours, the more you will be given reasons to be proven otherwise. Live life with the acceptance that you are here for a temporary amount of time, with a purpose that needs to be fulfilled with sabr and tawakkul.
With that mindset, what ever 'calamity' hits you will be dealt with easily, whereas living with the mindset that the world is a place of fun - you will be crushed over and over again. Don't sacrifice the ocean (Akhirah), for the bowl(Dunya).

                Allah says in the Quran, "you will surely be asked that Day about your blessings." [102:8]
                This is a reminder that the more blessings you have in this dunya, the more you will be held accountable on the Day of Judgement. The more money you have, the more you will be asked about how you spent it. The more children you have, the more you'll be asked about how you raised them. The higher your position at work, the more you'll be asked about how you treated those below you. The better your health, the more you'll be asked about how you spent your energy. The more you have, the more questions you'll be asked.
                So count your responsibilities. Ask Allah for blessings wisely. And ask Him to let every blessing be a means to get closer to Him.
